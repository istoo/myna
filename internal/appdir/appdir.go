// Package appdir decides where myna keeps its own files: the one place
// every other package asks (#508).
//
// Installed, that is ~/.config/myna ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/myna) for what
// myna keeps and ~/.cache/myna ($XDG_CACHE_HOME/myna) for what it
// can fetch again, as it always was. Portable, when a folder named "data"
// (or a file named ".portable") sits beside myna, everything myna
// keeps goes into that data folder, its caches into data/cache and the
// Windows webview's profile into data/webview2 (no Start-menu shortcut or
// App Paths entry is made either), and
// nothing of myna's own is written to the user's profile, the way VS
// Code's portable mode works. "Beside myna" is the folder holding the
// executable, with links followed; for a Mac app it is the folder holding
// Myna.app (a file put inside the bundle would break its signature), and
// for an AppImage the folder holding the .AppImage file, not the folder it
// is mounted at while it runs.
//
// What isn't myna's own stays where its owner reads it: the agents'
// configs (~/.claude, ~/.codex…), the sign-ins they keep in the system
// keychain, the folders the OS reads for autostart and link handling, and
// temporary folders.
//
// A data folder in a folder every app or download shares (/Applications on
// a Mac; the home folder, Downloads, Desktop and Documents everywhere) is
// taken for myna's own only when it already holds myna's files and the
// installed folder doesn't, or with a ".portable" marker: a "data" folder
// there is as likely another app's or the user's own. Taking one showed a
// user who had never asked for portable an empty myna (#989), and wrote
// myna's files into a Downloads\data folder a Windows user's archiver
// empties, so a provider just added was gone (tangle778 on X). Where the
// system keeps Downloads, Desktop or Documents off home (moved to D:\ or
// OneDrive on Windows, ~/下载 on Linux) only a data folder holding none of
// myna's files is passed over: before v0.1.2648 those folders weren't
// judged at all, so a data folder there holding myna's files is one this
// user's myna has been keeping its files in, and an update never moves
// them back to an installed folder from long ago (jwaitq on Discord).
//
// The decision is made once, from the executable as it was when myna
// started: an update moving the running copy aside (into .myna-update on
// a Mac, to myna.exe.old on Windows) leaves it running from somewhere
// else, and its files must not move with it.
